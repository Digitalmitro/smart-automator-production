                        <b>   “Privacy Policy”</b> </span>).


                </p>
                <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and the <a>Smart Automator Happiness Pledge</a> (the “Happiness Pledge”) for the country in which the Task is performed (which are each incorporated by reference, and referred to collectively, herein as the <b>“Agreement”</b>), governs your access to and use of the Platform.  The Agreement also includes all other supplemental policies and terms referenced and/or linked to within these Terms or which are otherwise made available to you, all of which also apply to your use of the Platform and are incorporated into the Agreement by reference (including, without limitation, the IKEA Pre-Paid Assembly Service Terms and Conditions for IKEA Pre-paid Assembly Tasks, as applicable ). </p>
                <p>FOR U.S. AND CANADIAN USERS, SECTION 24 CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST Smart Automator TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING, IF APPLICABLE, YOUR RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION.

                </p>
                <p>

                <h3>
                    1. The Platform.
                </h3>

                <h5>A. Online Marketplace.</h5>
                <p>The Platform is an online web- and app-based two-sided marketplace which enables connections between Clients and Taskers. “Client(s)” are individuals and/or businesses seeking to obtain short-term services (“Task(s)”), and “Tasker(s)” are businesses seeking to perform Tasks for Clients.  Clients and Taskers are referred to herein together as “User(s)”. </p>
                <p>Taskers are independent business owners, providing services under their own name or business name (and not under Smart Automator’s name), using their own tools and supplies.  Taskers choose the applicable rates for Tasks, without deduction by Smart Automator.  Taskers may (a) maintain a clientele without any restrictions from Smart Automator; (b) offer and provide their services elsewhere, including through competing platforms; and (c) accept or reject Clients and Service Agreements (defined below). Taskers are independent contractors of Clients, and Clients are therefore clients of Taskers, not Smart Automator.  </p>

                <p>Any reference to a Tasker being licensed or credentialed in some manner, or being "badged”, “reliable”, “reliability rate”, “elite”, “great value”, "background checked", “vetted” (or similar language) indicates only that the Tasker has completed a relevant user account registration process or met certain criteria and does not, and shall not be deemed to, represent anything else. Any such description: (i) is intended to be useful information for Clients to evaluate when they make their own decisions about the identity and suitability of Taskers whom they select or interact, or contract with via the Platform; and (ii) is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Smart Automator of a Tasker’s skills or qualifications or whether they are licensed, insured, trustworthy, safe or suitable.  </p>

                <h5>B. Smart Automator Role.</h5>
                <p>The Platform is not an employment agency service or business, and Smart Automator is not an employer of any User. Users are not employees, partners, representatives, agents, joint venturers, independent contractors or franchisees of Smart Automator.

                </p>
                <p>Users hereby acknowledge and agree that (a) Smart Automator does not (i) perform Tasks nor employ individuals to perform Tasks, (ii) supervise, scope, direct, control or monitor Taskers’ work (including that Smart Automator does not set Taskers’ work locations, work hours, or terms of work), nor provide tools or supplies to, or pay any expenses of, Taskers, or (iii) have any control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of Tasks or Users (or the acts or omissions thereof), nor of the integrity, responsibility, competence, qualifications, communications, or the ratings or reviews provided by Users with respect to each other; and (b) the formation of a Service Agreement will not, under any circumstances, create any responsibility or liability for Smart Automator, nor any employment or other relationship between Smart Automator and the Users or between the Client and the Tasker.  Users do not have authority to, and may not act as agent for, nor bind or make any representations on behalf of, Smart Automator (including that Taskers may not modify all or any part of the Smart Automator fees (see Section 3 below).
